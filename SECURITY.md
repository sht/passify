   - Describe the vulnerability in detail
   - Include steps to reproduce if possible
   - Share the potential impact

2. **Alternatively**, you can:
   - Create a private GitHub security advisory by going to the repository's Security tab
   - Provide appropriate details about the vulnerability

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)
- Your contact information (optional, for follow-up)
